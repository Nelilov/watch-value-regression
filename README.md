Regression analysis of factors influencing watch prices and long-term value retention in the secondary market.


# ⌚ Watch Value Regression Analysis

This project explores the factors that influence wristwatch prices and their ability to retain or increase value over time in the secondary market.

Using regression-based analysis, the goal is to identify which watch characteristics have a statistically significant impact on market pricing and long-term value retention.

## 📊 Data Collection Strategy

The dataset will be built using publicly available watch listings and market information from online marketplaces and aggregated sources.

Data collection focuses on:
- Watch characteristics and specifications  
- Market and resale prices  
- Temporal information to assess value evolution  

The dataset will be cleaned, standardized, and enriched to ensure analytical consistency.
