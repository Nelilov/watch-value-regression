## 🧩 Step 1 – Define the Research Question

### Central Question
**Which watch characteristics significantly influence market price and long-term value retention?**

To avoid confusion, the analysis explicitly separates two concepts:

**Price** refers to what makes a watch expensive at a given point in time.  
It reflects the current market valuation.

**Value** refers to a watch’s ability to retain or increase its price over time.  
It captures long-term stability or appreciation rather than short-term pricing.

Based on this distinction, the project focuses on two target variables:

- `price`: current market price  
- `value_retention`: price variation over time (expressed as a ratio or percentage)

This separation allows the analysis to distinguish price-driving factors from value-preserving factors.
